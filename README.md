# secret-clients

Experimental repo for working on various Secret Network client types.

- `rsecret` is the main client here, using gRPC and gRPC-web. Inspired by [secret.js](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js).
- `secret-rpc` is a continuation of https://github.com/chris-ricketts/localsecret-rs and https://github.com/FloppyDisck/secret-rpc.
- `secret-grpc-gateway` is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project, with a lot of manual editing. It uses `reqwest` and also supports WASM.

Hopefully I can make one generic enough to use any inner client type (gRPC, RPC, REST).
